# bioHSI_2018
This repository is for the Stanford Earth Young Internship over the summer of 2018.

In this internship, we will be writing to publish a research paper and use GitHub to document our work and code.

We will also be posting blogs and images of our experiences on GitHub. Some of these experiences will document trips to Pinnacles National Park and other places.

Since our work will involve using language R to gather statistics, we will also record R practice and exercises on GitHub.
